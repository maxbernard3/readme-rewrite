## Troubleshooting

### Startup Issues

Problems such as freezes or visual errors may be caused by outdated graphics drivers.  
- **Solution**: Update your graphics driver or revert to the default driver provided by your operating system.
- If experiencing issues with 3D object rendering, disable **OpenGL**:
  ```
  Tools → Options → OpenOffice.org → View → 3D view → Uncheck "Use OpenGL"
  ```

### Clipboard Issues

Copying and pasting between OpenOffice.org 1.x and 2.4 may fail using OpenOffice.org's format.  
- **Workaround**: Use **Edit → Paste Special** and select a format other than OpenOffice.org’s native format, or open files directly in version 2.4.

### ALPS/Synaptics Touchpad Scrolling Issue (Windows)

If scrolling doesn't work with your ALPS/Synaptics notebook touchpad, edit the configuration file at:
```
C:\Program Files\Synaptics\SynTP\SynTPEnh.ini
```
Add the following lines:
```ini
[OpenOffice.org]
FC = "SALFRAME"
SF = 0x10000000
SF |= 0x00004000
```
Then restart your computer.

### Emailing Documents

If the application crashes or hangs when using email features (**File → Send → Document by email** or **Document as PDF attachment**), this may be due to Windows MAPI file compatibility issues. For detailed solutions, visit the [Microsoft Knowledge Base](http://www.microsoft.com) and search "mapi dll."
